# ggplot2 Script
**An R script for building strip charts, kernel density plots, and line graphs with the ggplot2 package.**

This repository comes out of work I performed for [Ecotrust](https://ecotrust.org/) and the [Portland Urban Forestry Commission](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/41487) as part of [Azavea's Summer of Maps Fellowship](http://www.summerofmaps.com/).

The script itself offers a clean, simple template for generating strip charts, kernel density plots, and line graphs with R's **ggplot2** and **dplyr** packages. To check out what these visualizations look like, take a peek at [this layout](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56807079c647adf832f83799/t/57c26840ff7c5049cd2d1445/1472358467174/Ecotrust_ChangeDetection_Layout.pdf) I created visualizing urban canopy change at multiple geographic scales across the city of Portland, OR. And to give it a shot for yourself, clone the repo, experiment with the test data provided (Canopy_Data.csv), or load in your own data. Now get graphing!
